# MQTT Plugin for CraftBeerPi 3.0

This plugins allows to connect to an MQTT Message broker to receive sensor data and invoke actors.

Change this to work with Tastmota relays and multiple DS18B20 sensors attached to same Tastmota device.

*** Payload for the sensors is now the device Ids, not the payload location

## Installation


### Install missing python lib
After installation please install python MQTT lib paho

```pip install paho-mqtt```

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1

### Install MQTT message broker

Second step is to install an MQTT message broker on your Raspberry Pi.
An open source message broker is mosquitto (https://mosquitto.org/)

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto

# Furhter commands to control mosquitto service
sudo service mosquitto status
sudo service mosquitto stop
sudo service mosquitto start
```

The current version don't support username and password log for the mqtt broker

# MQTT Test Client 
A nice MQTT test client is mqtt.fx http://www.mqttfx.org/


# Plugin config

## MQTT Sensor

- Enter the message topic
- If the data in the payload is in a dictionary, specify the path in "Payload dictionary" with '.' seperators. EG
  - msg = { "Name":"MySensor", "Sensor": {"Value": 32 , "Type" : "1-wire"}
  - "Payload Dict" = Sensor.Value
- If you data is raw eg (mosquitto_pub -d -t temperture -m 32), leave "Payload Dictionary" Blank
- Enter prefered unit up to 3 chars
